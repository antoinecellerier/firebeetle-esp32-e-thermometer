bat 2954 mV at 2021-11-08 11:30 ... something's draining current even when shut down

ran for 739486 seconds = 8.5 days

3.2 => 3 V took a few hours only (didn't see the 3.2 V warning display)
battery rated for 2.6Ah (9.62Wh)

=> ~12.6 mA average consumption which is x1000 more than deep sleep target (~10µA)

Assumptions without proper multi-meter measurments
* deep sleep is not measurable probably < 1 mA lets assume ~0.5mA
* each wake up takes 2s at 40mA
* each refresh takes 15s at 50mA
* each screen clear takes 30s at 50mA

* 2s wake-up is 91% of energy budget, deep sleep is 3% of energy budget
* 1s wake-up is 83% of energy budget, deep sleep is 6% of energy budget
* 0.5s wake-up is 72% of energy budget, deep sleep is 10% of energy budget

1.5s wake-up => ~2.5 Ah

First priority: save on wake-up time/energy consumption
- 40 mA is inline with measurements at https://diyi0t.com/reduce-the-esp32-power-consumption/
- Adjust CPU frequency to 80 MHz? (defaults to 240 MHz)
- Use ULP to probe temperature? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QIcUTBB7Ww https://github.com/fhng/ESP32-ULP-1-Wire https://github.com/duff2013/ulptool https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/issues/1491 https://github.com/platformio/platform-espressif32/issues/95 

Other TODOs:
- Use ESP-IDF logging facilities https://thingpulse.com/esp32-logging/
- Use PROGMEM https://www.e-tinkers.com/2020/05/do-you-know-arduino-progmem-demystified/


# Current measurement first soldered prototype Nov 30 2021

https://wiki.dfrobot.com/FireBeetle_Board_ESP32_E_SKU_DFR0654 see "Low Power Pad"
Measurements with UT61E+
Powered at 4V on VCC
Typical powered consumption: ~ 45 mA
With Low Power Pad not cut: ~ 490 µA
With Low Power Pad cut: ~ 71 µA / Sometimes ~125 µA ?!?
With setup calling pinMode(2, OUTPUT or 0) and going directly to sleep and all components connected ~ 66 µA
With setup directly going to deep sleep and all components connected ~ 27 µA in deep sleep
With setup directly going to deep sleep and all components connected except DS18B20-PAR's data ping ~ 25 µA deep sleep
Board with no connections other than VCC & GND consumes ~ 14 µA in deep sleep
