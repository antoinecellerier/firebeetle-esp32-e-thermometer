"""Authored PCB layout: board outline, placement, tracks, vias, zones, silk.

Coordinates are board-relative millimetres (origin = board top-left corner);
pcb.py adds BOARD["origin"] to everything. Rotations are KiCad footprint
orientations in degrees (CCW positive; with y down, +90 maps (x,y)->(y,-x)).

PLACE:  {ref: (x, y, rot)}                     all footprints top side
TRACKS: [(net, layer, width_mm, [nodes...])]   node = "REF.PAD" | (x, y);
        unaligned consecutive nodes get one auto 45-degree dogleg
        (diagonal leg first). net is the circuit.py name ("~" names allowed —
        pcb.py resolves them to the exported KiCad net); every REF.PAD node
        must belong to that net (build error otherwise).
VIAS:   [(net, x, y)]                          through via, DEFAULT_VIA sizes
STITCH: [(x, y)]                               GND stitching vias
COPPER_ZONES: [(net, layer, [(x, y) corners])] filled polygons, lowest priority
KEEPOUTS: [dict(name=, layers=[...], rect=(x1, y1, x2, y2),
                tracks=, vias=, fills=, pads=)] rule areas
SILK:   [(text, x, y, size_mm, rot)]           F.SilkS text, thickness 0.15*size

Floorplan (48x35; pouch-adjacent target relaxed for the antenna keep-out,
booster HV clearances and the routable-density limit):
