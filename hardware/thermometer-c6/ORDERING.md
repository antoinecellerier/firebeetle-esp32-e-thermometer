# Ordering — thermometer-c6 at JLCPCB

Order checklist for the `make fab` bundle. The fab pipeline (render → DRC →
gerbers/drill → CPL/BOM → zip → `verify/check_fab.py`) is the mechanism;
this file is the human procedure around it. Settled fab decisions live in
`CLAUDE.md` ("Settled decisions — don't re-ask").

## 1. Generate & upload

- [ ] Check out the ordering commit on a **clean tree** and run `make fab`.
      A dirty tree is refused so the `rev A <hash> <date>` silk stamp names the
      exact committed source (`FAB_FORCE=1` overrides but makes the stamp a lie
      — don't ship one).
- [ ] Upload `out/fab/thermometer-c6-gerbers-<hash>-<date>.zip` (12 files:
      9 gerbers + drill + drill-map + job) to the JLCPCB quote page.

## 2. Board fabrication options

- [ ] Dimensions **48×35mm**, **2 layers**, **1.6mm**, outer copper **1oz**,
      qty **≥5**, solder mask green, TG **≥135**.
- [ ] **Surface finish: ENIG.** Chosen for flat pads under the 0.5mm-pitch
      LGA-10 sensor and the 0.5mm FPC — the board sits at JLC's 0.20mm HASL
      clearance floor, so HASL bumps are a risk there.
- [ ] **Via Covering: "Epoxy Filled & Capped" (POFV) — REQUIRED.** The
      via-in-pad escapes depend on it; the 0.3mm via drills are within JLC's
      fill limit.
- [ ] **Mark on PCB: "Order Number (Specify Position)".** The `JLCJLCJLCJLC`
      token is authored on back silk at (6.5, 13.95) rotated 90° — stood
      vertically just east of the antenna keep-out outline; JLC prints the order
      number there instead of a random spot.

## 3. Assembly options

- [ ] **Economy PCBA, top side only.** All assembled parts are on F.Cu by
      construction (TPs/jumpers are copper-only, headers are DNP).
- [ ] Upload `out/fab/thermometer-c6-bom.csv` + `out/fab/thermometer-c6-cpl.csv`.
      **75 placements / 37 BOM lines.**
- [ ] Expect extended-part fees on the non-basic parts. If JLC flags a part as
      not economy-eligible, switch that part or the order type.

## 4. Stock re-verification (before quoting)

Re-check LCSC/JLC stock — several parts run thin:

- [ ] U1 ESP32-C6-MINI-1-N4 **C5736265**
- [ ] Q3 Si1308EDL **C469327** (thin — fallback Si1304BDL clone **C7419947**)
- [ ] 10k **C25744** (alt **C60490**)
- [ ] **U5 BMP581 C5362283 — if out of stock, populate U6 BMP585 instead:**
      in `generator/circuit.py` set U5 `dnp=True` and U6/C26/C27 `dnp=False`
      (populate-exactly-one — both strap I2C 0x47), `make check`, commit, then
      re-run `make fab`. The BOM/CPL pick up the swap automatically.

## 5. FPC connector warning

- [ ] J4 must be **C2856831 (XUNPU FPC-05FB-24PH20, DUAL contact)**. The
      bottom-contact sibling **C2856805** looks identical in search results and
      does **NOT** work with the panel cable — never substitute.

## 6. Rotation/polarity verification (MANDATORY)

- [ ] In JLC's component-placement preview, walk `out/fab/rotation-checklist.md`
      row by row (22 orientation-critical parts). **The preview is ground
      truth** — the correction table in `generator/fab_cpl.py` is a first guess,
      and the SOT-23 family carries a known community-table conflict.
- [ ] On a mismatch: adjust the part's delta in `fab_cpl.py`, mark the entry
      `verified:`, re-run `make fab`, re-upload the CPL. If **all** parts are
      uniformly rotated or offset, suspect origin handling, not per-part deltas.
- [ ] Top-priority rows: **U5** (rotated LGA is invisible after reflow), **J4**
      pin 1, **U1** antenna WEST, and all FETs.
- [ ] Answer any JLC engineer polarity-confirmation email against the same
      checklist.

## 7. Archive after submitting

- [ ] Copy the exact uploaded zip + CPL + BOM + the ticked
      `rotation-checklist.md` into `archive/order-<YYYY-MM-DD>/`.
- [ ] Append a provenance entry to `archive/README.md`: commit hash, stamp,
      JLC order number, and the options chosen (ENIG / POFV / order-number
      position).
- [ ] Commit.
